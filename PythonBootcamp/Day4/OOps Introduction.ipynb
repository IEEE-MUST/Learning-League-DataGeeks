    "#Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions.\n",
    "#These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects.\n",
    "#These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program.\n",
    "#For example, a car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object then its properties would be – its color, its model, its price, its brand, etc. \n",
    "#And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, gear change.\n"
