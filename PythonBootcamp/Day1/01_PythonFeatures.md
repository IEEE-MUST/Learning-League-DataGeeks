# Features of Python
### 1. Easy To Learn
### 2. Interpreted: If you’re familiar with any languages like C++ or Java, you must first compile it, and then run it. But in Python, there is no need to compile it.Internally, its source code is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.So, all you need to do is to run your Python code without worrying about linking to libraries, and a few other things.By interpreted, we mean the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once. Because of this, it is easier to debug your code.
### 3. Open Sourced:  This means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it as, use it as well as share it.
### 4. Object-oriented: Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc.
### 5. Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically-typed. This means that the type for a value is decided at runtime, not in advance.This is why we don’t need to specify the type of data while declaring it.This is all about the features of the python programming language.
### 6. High Level: Python is a high-level language. This means that as programmers, we don’t need to remember the system architecture. Also, we need not manage memory. This makes it more programmer-friendly and is one of the key python features.
### 7. Portable: Let’s assume you’ve written a Python code for your Windows machine. Now, if you want to run it on a Mac, you don’t need to make changes to it for the same.In other words, you can take one code and run it on any machine. This makes Python a portable language.
